This is the readme for observer pattern that we will be using.

This is a behavior pattern, that follows a publisher-subscribers relationship.

Say there are three states of any object, then behavior pattern helps in notifying 
the other objects that the one of the state of the object has changed so they can
adjust it according to their own needs.
