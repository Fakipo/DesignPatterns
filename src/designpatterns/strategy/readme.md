Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern and it is concerned with
creating a family of algorithms for the objects.

Which means that this will define the behavior of the objects.

For example, lets say there is a car object then its potential behaviors would be 
drive, park, break, accelerate etc.

So this is what behavioral design patterns are used for


In this problem, we will build a video game.

Video game will have two characters (Now remember characters building can be done by
any creational design pattern like factory) and their behaviors would be running and 
walking that we will design in this solution.
